The learning in this artifical intelligence will be recorded in q_table.pkl. Even when you close the program the learning information will be used next time
in the "train(agent, episodes=10000)" part if you increase the episodes machine will get more try (will increase the learning)
by decreseing the epsilon value you could make machine play more deterministic
alpha(learning rate) and gamma(discount factor) changing those will change the ai's learning speed.
